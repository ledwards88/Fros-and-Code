# Fros-and-Code
I'm a beginner programmer pursuing a MS in computer science online while trying to master java. I am not CS undergrad and have taken Java programming 1 and finite mathematics so far, so my knowledge is limited. Overall, I just want to learn all that I can to become more efficient and reach my goal of becoming a developer some day. The projects I post are just for me to learn from my mistakes and through the help of those gracious enough to help me. All constructive criticisms are welcomed. I appreciate everyone who takes the time to work with me :D
