___________________________________________________

Create a class that holds the service description, price, and number of
minutes it takes to perform the service. Include a constructor that requires
arguments for all three data fields and three get methods that each return
one of the data field’s values. Save the class as -Service.java-.

b. Write an application named SalonReport that contains an array to hold six
Service objects, and fill it with the data from Table 9-6. Include methods to
sort the array in ascending order by each of the data fields. Prompt the user for
the preferred sort order, and display the list of services in the requested order.
Save the program as -SalonReport.java-.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
• Enhance the program by displaying a menu that asks the user how they want to sort the services menu.  
  1) Sort by Service Description, 2) Sort by Price, 3) Sort by Time (Minutes), or 0) to Exit.  Add a do...while() 
  loop that keeps prompting the user for the next preferred sort order until the user finally chooses “0” to exit.
